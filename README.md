# Learning - Javascript Week 4

#### This is a self-reflective project to identify our strengths and weaknesses as coders and develop a plan for working on those weak spots.

#### By Holly Wilkalis

## Description

After making my strengths and weaknesses list, it's clear that I've got a lot of anxiety about being ready for the technical interviews, and that I feel like I need to work on technical vocabulary and get better at writing code from scratch.

Since I also wanted to practice the Angular routing from this week, I made a small site with my S/W list and resources and steps I can take to address this. I wanted a central repository to keep track of some of these ideas and tools. I did a lot of reading and research, and also worked on some Javascript exercises with FreeCodeCamp and began my first project with Javascript30.

For further practice, I plan to try to continue maintaining this and adding a more specific task list for myself to increase accountability.
