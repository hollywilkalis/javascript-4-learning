# Learning

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.5.

## Strengths
* Lots of experience managing content and organizing information on the front end of sites.
* Curiosity!
* Not afraid to "break" things or experiment in pursuit of knowledge/new skills.
* I have a good feel for user interface design and how users interact with content.
* I think that with some further work on my technical vocabulary (see below) I'd be great in some sort of business analyst role.
* I am a whiz with Bootstrap - its logic and structure makes sense to me.
* I secretly enjoy cleaning up messy sites. I've done a lot of that working on sites managed with a CMS (looking for redundancies, cleaning up outdated content, better structuring HTML within pages to suit the information flow, etc). I want to keep working on my Javascript/etc. skills so that I can apply these same skills to that end of things.


## Weaknesses
* The prospect of technical interviews, particularly whiteboarding, is giving me a lot of anxiety. I don't think my ability to write code without resorting to notes and cheat sheets and heavily using Atom/Typescript/etc. prompts and assists is as strong as it needs to be. I get there, but I'm not fast and still relying a lot on trial and error (it's just one of the ways in which I learn).
* My technical vocabulary. I find that though I often understand the concepts I have trouble expressing it using the correct terminology. I want to work on my technical fluency.
* Despite the above, I need more confidence in my own skills so I don't choke in an interview, even if I can't immediately find the right words.
* I have in the past found that I'm good at troubleshooting technical issues. I'm persistent and I think I have good instincts. When it comes to coding though, I need to work more on this by 1) consciously making a list of all the things I know that I can try and 2) continuing to improve my grasp of the language to make sure that I'm better able to understand error messages and technical documentation.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
